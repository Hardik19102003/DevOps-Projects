### Deploying the project on AWS

1. Clone this project in the remote VM
```
git clone https://github.com/verma-kunal/AWS-Session.git
```
2. Setup the following environment variables - `(.env)` file
```
DOMAIN= ""

> For this project, we'll have to set up an [Elastic IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) for our EC2 & that would be our `DOMAIN`

3. Initialise and start the project
```
npm install
npm run start
```

> NOTE - We will have to edit the **inbound rules** in the security group of our EC2, in order to allow traffic from our particular port
